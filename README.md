# Monitoring-Of-Human-Body-Parameters-Using-Wearable-Wireless-Sensor-Network-IOT
With tons of new healthcare technology start-ups, IoT is rapidly revolutionizing the healthcare industry. In this project, we have designed the IoT Based Patient Health Monitoring System using ESP8266 &amp; Arduino. The IoT platform used in this project is ThingSpeak. ThingSpeak is an open-source Internet of Things (IoT) application and API to store and retrieve data from things using the HTTP protocol over the Internet or via a Local Area Network. This IoT device could read the pulse rate and measure the surrounding temperature. It continuously monitors the pulse rate and surrounding temperature and updates them to an IoT platform.  The Arduino Sketch running over the device implements the various functionalities of the project like reading sensor data, converting them into strings, passing them to the IoT platform, and displaying measured pulse rate and temperature on character LCD.
